	Caring for Roxie, the grape-loving dog

	The staff at Wisdom worked tirelessly to determine why our three-year old Labrador Retriever, Roxie, started going into sudden kidney failure. They stabilized her and provided fluids until her kidneys were again functioning normal, but it was still a mystery as to what caused her health to decline so quickly.

	The vet noted our address on Roxie’s chart, and asked if we lived on one of the orchards in the vicinity, and if Roxie had a habit of eating grapes off the vine. Our answer was “of course – she’s a Labrador.” That day we learned just how toxic grapes and raisins are to pets, and Roxie is no longer allowed to roam unattended in the orchard.
